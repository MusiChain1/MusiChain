# 10 Benefits of Music

1. **Relaxing patients before surgery**: A study found that listening to music helped put cardiovascular patients in a state of calm and relaxation before their surgeries. This is a very important benefit for the nearly 4 million people who have heart surgery each year in the United States.
2. **Relieving stress after surgeries**: Music doesn't only help before surgeries. Another study found that listening to music during post-surgical rest (especially in cardiac patients) helped patients relax and reduced their stress levels.
3. **Helping cancer patients manage stress and anxiety:** Music has been shown to help cancer patients communicate their feelings, manage stress, and ease physical discomfort and pain. It also reduces anxiety and improves their quality of life.
4. **Improving recovery for stroke patients:** Researchers in Finland found that when stroke patients listened to music for two hours a day, their verbal memory and attention improved, and they had better moods compared to patients who didn't listen to music or listened to audio books.
5. **Improving sleep quality:** Listening to classical music has been shown to be an effective treatment for insomnia in college students, making it a safe, inexpensive, and alternative option to sleep-inducing drugs and tranquilizers.
6. **Increase endurance:** listening to those workout playlists can improve physical performance and increase endurance during a heavy exercise session. This works, in part, by its distracting power: while focusing on your favorite album, you may not notice that you've run an extra mile.
7. **Pain relief:** music can significantly reduce the perceived intensity of pain, especially in geriatric, intensive care, or palliative medicine (an area of health care that focuses on preventing and relieving suffering in patients).
8. **Helping people to eat less:** one study found that music and soft lights in the meal environment can help people to slow down while eating and help them to eat less in a single meal (perhaps because relaxing and going a little slower helps them to be more conscious about their satisfaction ratings).
9. **Improve blood vessel function**: scientists have found that the emotions that patients experience while listening to music have a healthy effect on blood vessel function. The music made the study participants feel happier, which resulted in increased blood flow in their vessels).
10. **Relieve symptoms of depression:** when you're feeling down, music can help you get back up again. Research suggests that the genre of music matters: classical and meditative music seems to be particularly inspiring, while genres such as heavy metal and electronic music can make the symptoms even worse.
