# The evolution of investors

After the emergence of Bitcoin and the marked rise of crypto, this market started to gain more and more strength and relevance. Allied to this, we live in a time when investment alternatives grow every day in line with technological evolution. Currently, the cryptocurrency market is worth about $2 trillion, and according to Multicoin Capital this market may reach $7 trillion. Contrary to what you might think, investors are spread all over the world, below, by the image you can check in more detail:

Even though it has risks, as everyone knows, the market presents great profit potential. Whether you are a beginner or experienced investor, having cryptocurrencies in your portfolio can be a great option if you have a more aggressive profile (those who understand the market fluctuations and know the risk of investment). With the evolution of this market, institutional investors have already started to move to have positions in this type of market, proving that this world of digital currencies is here to stay. Currently, the volume of financial institutions operating in this market is relatively low, drawing the attention of several experts on the growth potential. According to analysts, the volume of money transacted by market players can multiply several times over causing a natural rise of various cryptos available in this world. Even if it is a prediction, there are technical elements that are advocated and a technological trend that can confirm the thesis.

* The opportunities go beyond Bitcoin

We don't need to go too far to prove that Bitcoin is not the only opportunity; the Metaverse and NFTs alone already serve as great examples.
