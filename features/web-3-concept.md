# ðŸ”Š Web 3 Concept

## **Web 1**&#x20;

The Internet was for sharing technical information online and connecting it through hyperlinks - which persists, for example, for news sites that link news stories to related content. At this time the Internet was still the exclusive domain of a few people, the connection was slow, and computers had considerably limited performance compared to what we have today. Because of this, information was published in a decentralized manner, but it was still a power that only a few had. The big companies that emerged at this time were, for example, Google and Yahoo, which had the mission of organizing all the content that was available on the Internet.

## **Web 2**&#x20;

Web 2.0 was marked by the development of digital platforms that allowed user-generated content. The clearest example of this movement was the creation of social networks such as Orkut, Twitter, and Facebook, and YouTube, which allowed anyone to publish videos. In addition, there was the creation of technology companies so large that they could even "monopolize" your attention with sophisticated content recommendation algorithms and inhibit competition from rivals, such as Facebook (Meta) and Google (Alphabet) - two big techs that symbolize well the possibilities offered by web 2.0.

## **Web 3**&#x20;

Web 3 is a proposal to bring together the best of the previous two online worlds: decentralization and user-generated content, and add to all this the distributed ledger, in blockchain. If you don't know what blockchain is, the easiest way to understand is with the analogy of an accounting ledger, in which everything is written down in an immutable way. Each of the blocks, called records, that are added to the blockchain connect to the previous one, forming a chain. All this has the technology called cryptography, a coding so complex that it cannot be broken by even the most advanced computers in the world. Blockchain is the link that connects web3 to cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The decentralization of finance comes about by relegating the storage of information, be it financial or otherwise, to the blockchain.
