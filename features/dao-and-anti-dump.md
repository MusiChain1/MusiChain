## Anti-Dump

We will have an antidumping system, where the BSC protocol determines the architectural projection of transactions and blockchain. With this, we will have 15 blocks, where there will be no transactions, and with this all negotiations will be executed via blockchain, where we have total transparency and security for our investors, a mathematical algorithm of a high level of complexity, which acts as a firewall to extinguish attacks, and if it is necessary to validate information, we have a hash, where all encrypted information is stored.
