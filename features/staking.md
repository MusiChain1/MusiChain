# ðŸ”Š Staking

We will offer MSC token holders fixed interest rates based on the staking plans purchased: We have two staking plans available, fully reflecting the amount of token users have.

**Here are some guidelines to follow:**

* Investors will not be able to unwind your investment before the expiration date&#x20;
* After the scheduled staking has been completed, investors can withdraw their profit, which will be deposited directly into their wallets, or they can extend the staking, which will accrue interest.

Our main goal in our project is security, and with this we will have constant audits that will guarantee our investors reliability.

Below we will address the two possible plans, in the initial phase of the project, as we have two more updates with new APY plans

We will condition artists who partner with us to a percentage of our investors' monthly fees, giving them the possibility of even greater projections.

**Addendum: The investor to perform staking, must have $50 in MSC**

| Tuition     | Singer | Investors |
| ----------- | ------ | --------- |
| $5 / month  | 30%    | 10%       |
| $15 / month | 60%    | 20%       |

Staking rewards only go to the artists they listen to. Staking reward to musician from every subscriber is calculated by A = F â‡¤ C/M â‡¤ L/365 â‡¤ (Annual rate of staking reward %) where:&#x20;

&#x20;A = The amount of staking reward a musician gets from one subscriber, F = Total number of tokens a subscriber stakes for subscription,&#x20;

C = Hours the subscriber listens to the awarded musician&#x20;

M = Total number of hours the subscriber listens to in each

L = Number of staking days.&#x20;

**Practical example**

* The investor will initially contribute $50
* You will listen to the music of your favorite singer "A" for 40 hours
* You will listen to the music of your favorite singer "B" for 60 hours
* Singer "A" and "B", will have rights to rewards from the Investor
* taking into account the annual staking fee at 15% ...Singer "A" will receive 0.38 tokens from the Investor's staking and Singer "B" will receive 0.98 tokens from the Investor's staking

Reward tokens are minted from the reserved tokens of 50% of the initial supply

**Plan A**

* 30%-will be shared between artists and listeners&#x20;
* 30%-will be shared in MusiChain's fund
* 30%-Liquidity pool
* 10%-Burn

**Plan B**

* 60%-will be shared between artists and listeners&#x20;
* 30%-will be shared in MusiChain's fund
* 5%-Liquidity pool
* 5%-Burn
