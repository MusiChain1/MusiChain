The basis of the project, is simply listening to your favorite music, yet earning money by listening to it, that makes a trivial activity, profitable! We are in BETA phase of our platform, where our investors will be able to associate their portfolios and also perform the staking that we will have available in it. We are in progress with our app to be placed on the IOS/ ANDROID platforms.

All types of amendments or changes will be voted on, and recorded by each administrator in a separate transaction, with the change being applied when there is sufficient consensus. Configuration phase - Only in this phase can administrators bypass this voting process.

## Protocol

We will use the BSC protocol for all transactions and architecture of our blockchain, We have the following configurations for our blocks:

* We have empty block configurations, for 10 blocks - example, there will be no transaction on these blocks...
* After the above configuration, we will be parked, until the time of a new transaction.
* Disk Space Savings
* Currency based on contracts with artists and record companies.
* FAR (Fun Action Reward) reward concept earn coins by performing a fun action, listen to your favorite songs.

**Addendum:** The size of each generated block is 8 Mega Bytes and the interval between blocks is 30 seconds.
