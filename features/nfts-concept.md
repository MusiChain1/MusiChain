# ðŸ”Š NFT's Concept

## Non-Interchangeable Tokens (NFT)&#x20;

Use cryptocurrency technology to create unique digital assets. It is possible to register ownership of collectibles, real estate, and even game characters with their respective scores, items, and the like.This market has grown exponentially in recent months, and we have even had sales at the world's most traditional auction house, Christie's of London. Those who buy NFT seek exclusivity and status.

The NFT, or non-fungible token, is a digital record of ownership of a particular asset, whether real or virtual. Token means cryptoactive, a digital asset that exists only within a shared database. Assets, digital or otherwise, can be classified into two groups:

**Fungible, which can be replaced or divided without loss of value.**&#x20;

* money;&#x20;
* bitcoin;&#x20;
* Fraction of a piece of land;&#x20;
* Fan tokens;&#x20;
* oil;&#x20;
* IBM stock.

Non-fungible, where each item is unique, and non-divisible.&#x20;

* Lot A-32 of the Alphaville 4 condominium;&#x20;
* A certain seat for a theater or show;&#x20;
* 10/100 copy of a work of art;&#x20;
* Autographed baseball card;&#x20;
* User @tuba33play of the game Dota II;&#x20;
* Bronze medal of boxer Abner Teixeira.

## How to invest in NFT?

The first thing an investor of non-interchangeable tokens needs to understand is that trading involves only one record in the shared database, the blockchain. In other words, the copyright of the item is not being traded.\
****Thus, by investing in NFT of a digital artwork you are buying the right to a "certified copy", recognized by the artist. It is up to you to make sure that the item is authorized by its creator.\
There are several marketplaces for NFTs, including OpenSea, Nifty Gateway, Rarible, SuperRare, and others. In addition to acting as a virtual art gallery, it allows artists to create non-interchangeable tokens without the need for programming or knowledge of cryptography.
