# ðŸ”Š DeFi Concept

## DeFi Concept

DeFi is short for decentralized finance, which loosely translated means decentralized finance. This term refers to a set of financial services and products that operate based on the guidelines and protocols of a blockchain.A blockchain is a kind of public database that stores information about every financial transaction in a system of blocks. For a record to be entered into the network, a validation process must be performed using a consensus algorithm.If the transaction is approved, it is added to the blockchain and receives a code that confirms its authenticity. In this way, it is possible to prevent changes to its content and allow users to perform financial transactions securely.

## DeFi Functionality

Now that you know what DeFi is, you need to know what makes it possible. DeFi applications work by means of smart contracts. These are computer codes that automatically execute the agreement when its clauses are met.

## Main DeFi Applications

Above, you saw that decentralized finance represents a set of financial products and services developed in the framework of a blockchain - mostly on ethereum. But what are they?

* **Cryptoactive Exchange** - At DeFi it is possible to create decentralized exchanges (DEX). In literal translation, the term means decentralized brokerage. It is used to refer to platforms that allow cryptoactive trading between users of a blockchain.
* **P2P Lending -**  In addition to facilitating cryptoactive trading via DEX, the DeFi protocol offers users the possibility of lending or borrowing with cryptocurrencies. The operation works like in the traditional model, but without intermediaries.
* **Asset Tokenization** - Another possibility with DeFi is the tokenization of assets. This is the process of creating a digital representation of assets that have economic value and can be traded.
* **Income protocols** - You have seen that DeFi can serve as a peer to peer (P2P) lending platform, that is, person to person. In addition, the decentralized finance system allows users to lend digital currencies for the network to perform credit transactions.
